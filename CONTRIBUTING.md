# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Mechanica.

This project is very new and it is just now being released as open source.
For that reason we don't have a full cohesive plan just yet. We mainly
just want to make sure everything is working the way we want it to.

Saying that, there is still a lot of work to do going forward.
So if you do have an idea or a suggestion, or you found a bug,
feel free to create an issue in the issue tracker.

# Filing Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, make sure to include the following where necessary:

1. What operating system are you using?
2. What version of Kotlin are you using?
3. What version of the JDK did you use to compile?
4. What did you do and can you recreate the bug consistently?
5. What did you expect to see or why do you think this is a bug?

# Suggesting Features or Enhancements

Because this is a very new project, there are a lot of
features and enhancements to be added.

Right now there is not a solid plan in place for what features we
are looking for but if you have an idea feel free to create an issue
and make sure to describe the reasons, motivation and benefits of such
a feature
